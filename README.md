# So_long
A small 2D game
So long is a project in the 42 cursus, where we (students) have to create a small 2D game in which a character collects the Collectibles (it can be anything: a coin, star, keybord...) to escape from the Exit. Originally the game was : a dolphin escapes Earth after eating some fish, but as you know
they can be replaced by anything, as long as keeping the game's concept the same.

In my game, the character is an astronaut who collects casquets before escaping through a piano, I know it's bizarre and nonsense, but you know it
doesn't have to make a sense, even life doesn't make sense so why my game has to make a sense. I will explain a little bit though, music has always
fascinated me, especially the piano, those melodies are magical, I have never played piano and I imagine that after I'll (have enough money and) buy a 
piano, the moment I play even the basic melody, I will be conveyed to another place, to a place full of peace and love. And I want my astronaut (after 
collecting red casquets) to be delivered to that place, of course through Piano.



to compile the project:
1. go to Headers
2. make (or make re)
3. ./so_long ../maps/map2.ber (you can try any map...)
